# Optimized Two-Pointer Solution for Maximum Area

**Improved AlgoEngine's Algorithm**

---

## Key Idea

Finding the largest number in an array using Python's `max()` function is surprisingly fast, even though it's O(n). This efficiency comes from CPU cache pre-fetching and the fact that `max()` is implemented in C in the standard CPython implementation ([source code](https://github.com/python/cpython)).

By knowing the largest height in advance, we can calculate the **maximum potential area** between a left and a right pointer. This allows us to stop searching as soon as we realize that even the largest possible area left to check is smaller than the best area we have already found.

## Example

In the example from the image:

- The largest height in the array is `6`.
- After a few pointer movements, we reach the state shown in the photo.
- Knowing the largest height is `6`, the maximum area we could possibly form now is:

`6 * (right - left) = 6 * 3 = 18`

- Since we have already found a solution with area `20`, we can **terminate the search**, saving 3 iterations of computation.
